                <h3>DIRECTOR: SHUNJI IWAI</h2>
                <h3>2001 / 146MIN / DCP</h2>
                <p class="card-text">Incredibly prescient in its understanding of how a still-young internet would fundamentally alter youth culture, Shunji‚Äôs film introduces Yuichi (Hayato Ichihara) in an ice field, the landscape gradually obscured by accreting chat room messages. Alienated from classmates and his old friend Shusuke (Shugo Oshinari), Yuichi retreats into his relationship with the songs of goth-inflected pop act Lily Chou-Chou‚Äîcreated for the film, with vocals by Salyu, though the three-piece reformed for the movie‚Äôs 10th anniversary‚Äîwhose music can do nothing to stop the bloody, hormone-fueled reckoning ahead. A clangorous collision of tradition and ultramodernity, innovative in its understanding of digital cinematography as a new medium with new rules.</p>

                <h3>1992 / 127MIN / DCP</h2>
                <p class="card-text">The picket lines formed by LBGTQ activists to protest the perceived negative depictions of gay and bisexual characters in this elegant erotic thriller, penned by professional sleaze Joe Eszterhas, didn‚Äôt do much to temper its huge popularity. Verhoeven's Basic Instinct made a star of ice queen blonde Sharon Stone, the femme fatale that Michael Douglas‚Äôs San Francisco detective, who‚Äôs investigating a rock star‚Äôs murder, just can‚Äôt keep his mitts off.</p>

              <h3>DIRECTOR: HOU HSIAO-HSIEN</h2>
              <h3>1985 / 138MIN / DCP</h2>
              <p class="card-text">Arguably the film in which all the elements of Hou‚Äôs meticulously controlled, objectively distanced mature style identifiably coalesce, and his first collaboration with crucial cohort Lee, the deeply personal coming-of-age story A Time to Live and a Time to Die‚Äîwhich Hou periodically narrates himself‚Äîdraws on his family‚Äôs experience of relocating to rural Taiwan from mainland China in the late ‚Äô40s, following the character of immigrant Ah-hsiao through some 20 years that encompass childhood self-discovery, adolescent rebellion, and the eventual compromises, regrets, and compensations of adulthood. ‚ÄúWorking in long takes and wide-screen, deep-focus compositions that frame the characters from a discreet distance, Hou allows the locations to seep into our own memories and experience, so that‚Ä¶ we come to know them almost as intimately as touchstones in our own lives.‚Äù ‚ÄîJonathan Rosenbaum, Chicago Reader</p>

              <h3>DIRECTOR: √âRIC ROHMER</h2>
              <h3>1981 / 106MIN / DCP</h2>
              <p class="card-text">The inaugural film of Rohmer‚Äôs ‚ÄúComedies and Proverbs‚Äù cycle, The Aviator‚Äôs Wife is a fleecy farce of romantic overanalysis that finds the director exploring the possibilities of handheld camerawork in following a narrative expression of the opening epigraph: ‚ÄúIt is impossible to think of nothing.‚Äù A young man sees his girlfriend‚Äôs ex leaving her apartment one early morning, and his imagination is off to the races, as stars Philippe Marlaud and Marie Rivi√®re introduce a younger, less perfectly articulate type of Rohmer character than those of the ‚ÄúMoral Tales.‚Äù A Metrograph Pictures release.</p>

              <h3>1998 / 113MIN / ENG SUB / DCP</h2>
              <p class="card-text">Lee‚Äôs floating camera drifts through the candlelit, opium-drenched dens of 1880s Shanghai in Hou‚Äôs elegant film of longing and long takes, adapted from Han Bangqing‚Äôs 1892 Wu language novel The Sing-song Girls of Shanghai, a classic that was translated into Mandarin Chinese and English by Chang. A quietly devastating, expertly modulated drama of intrigue and romance among the high-end ‚Äúflower girl‚Äù courtesans and their wealthy patrons, one of the latter played by the peerless Tony Leung Chiu-wai, Flowers of Shanghai ranks frequently as among the best films of the ‚Äô90s.</p>

              <h3>DIRECTOR: HUANG HSIN-YAO</h2>
              <h3>2017 / 102MIN / DCP</h2>
              <p class="card-text">Huang‚Äôs debut feature, winner of the top prize at the 19th Taipei Film Festival and one of Lee‚Äôs favorite works of recent Taiwanese cinema, is a crafty, pitch-black comedy of underclass resourcefulness, resentfulness, and envy about a security guard, Pickle (documentarian Cres Chuang), who works at a factory that produces statues of the Buddha. Discovering of a trove of dashboard camera videos documenting the womanizing factory owner‚Äôs sleazy secret life one night, Pickle, with his lone pal, Belly Button (Bamboo Chen), a scavenger who ekes out a living collecting recyclables, finds himself initiated into the unsavory hidden world of the unscrupulous superrich. A brilliant film about the haves and have-nots, shot in color and black and white by filmmaker Chung Mong-hong, with Huang himself providing a hysterically vulgar running commentary to the action.</p>

                <p class="card-text">Pati√±o (2023‚Äôs Samsara) draws from the deep well of Galician mythology for his meditative fiction feature debut, set in a seaside village in northwestern Spain‚Äîalso the setting of his documentary Coast of Death‚Äîthat has been rocked by news of the disappearance of a diver, Rubio (Rubio de Camelle), renowned locally for his ability to retrieve shipwrecked sailors‚Äô bodies. Their motionless vigil is overlaid with lyrical voiceover monologues, which are interrupted by the arrival of three witches tasked with searching for the absent Rubio. ‚ÄúA portrait of a seaside village suspended in an extraordinary catatonia. Its transfixion is contagious‚Ä¶ A majestic vision.‚Äù ‚ÄîThe New York Times</p>
